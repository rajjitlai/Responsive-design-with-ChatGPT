‚≠ê About ChatGPT:

                ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an 
                instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.
                
                It was first introduced in November 2022.
                
                In the world of AI, we are using different tools to 
                make more productive content in a short period of time.

                                      HTML file - index.html
                                      JS file - script.js
                                      CSS file - style.css
